# Windows Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal configuration files (dotfiles).

**Note:** This setup is tailored specifically for my workflow. If you wish to use or modify it, please **fork this repository**.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

-    [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/AzPepoze/dots-windows
     ```

2. **Run the installation script:**
   Double-click **`main.cmd`** or run it from the terminal:

     ```bash
     ./main.cmd
     ```

> **⚠️ Warning:** This will overwrite existing `komorebi.json` and `.config/yasb` files in your user profile. Back up your existing configs before running!

## Customization

To modify the configurations, edit the files in `dots/user/` and run `main.cmd` again to apply the changes to your user profile.
